==================================

This software and its associated Mi'kmaq language dictionary data are dedicated to the preservation, revitalization, and respectful sharing of Mi'kmaq language and culture.

## Cultural Acknowledgment

This work exists within and draws from the traditional territories and knowledge systems of the Mi'kmaq people. The Mi'kmaq language (Mi'kmawisimk) is a living language that has been spoken for thousands of years across Mi'kma'ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq people, spanning what is now known as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, parts of Quebec, and extending into Maine.

## For Our People, By Our People

This project is created:
- **For the Children**: To ensure that future generations have access to their ancestral language and can learn Mi'kmawisimk in the digital age
- **For the Elders**: To honor the knowledge keepers who have preserved this language through generations of challenge and change
- **For the Community**: To support language revitalization efforts and cultural continuity
- **For the Nation**: To strengthen Mi'kmaq identity and sovereignty through linguistic preservation
